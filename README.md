# Web Scraping with Selenium and Python

This project demonstrates web scraping using Selenium and Python. It uses the Selenium library to automate interactions with a website and extract information.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the web scraping script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python
- Google Chrome
- ChromeDriver (automatically managed by the project)
- Selenium (install via pip)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/breezeconcept/web-scraping-selenium.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd web-scraping-selenium

3.  Install the required Python packages:

    ```shell
    pip install selenium webdriver-manager


### Usage

Open the main.py file and customize the web scraping code to suit your needs. You may need to adjust the URLs, XPaths, and actions based on the specific website you want to scrape.

    Run the script:
    python main.py

The script will launch a Chrome browser and perform the web scraping tasks as defined.

The script is configured to keep the browser window open after execution for manual interaction. You can interact with the opened browser window as needed.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter SSL errors or other issues, please refer to the Troubleshooting section in the script comments or consult the project's issue tracker for solutions.
